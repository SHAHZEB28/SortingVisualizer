## Overview

This project is an educational tool designed to help users understand and compare different sorting algorithms by visualizing their step-by-step processes. The application provides a clean and intuitive interface where users can generate random arrays, select from a variety of classic sorting algorithms, and control the speed of the visualization to see exactly how each algorithm operates.

## Live Demo

## Features

* **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch algorithms sort an array of bars in real-time, with clear visual cues for element comparisons and swaps.
* **Multiple Algorithms**: Implements a variety of fundamental sorting algorithms, including:
    * Bubble Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Selection Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Quick Sort
* **Interactive Controls**:
    * **Generate New Array**: Create a new random array to visualize at any time.
    * **Adjustable Array Size**: Use a slider to increase or decrease the number of elements in the array.
    * **Variable Speed**: Control the speed of the animation to either quickly see the result or slow it down to study the algorithm's steps.
* **Responsive Design**: The user interface is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
